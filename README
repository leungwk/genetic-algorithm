Eval all in ga.clj. Give it some time.
Then in repl:
(in-ns 'ga.ga)
(require 'clojure.pprint)
(clojure.pprint/pprint (ga-rastrigin))
# will then print out best and "qbest 5" (ie. top 5)

* Bugs
** FileNotFoundException if =log/= does not exist at project top level
when called by writers, such as =clojure.contrib.duck-streams/append-spit=.
